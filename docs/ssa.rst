******************
IVOA SSA Interface
******************

Although the databases of *specdb* are primarily intended
to be accessed on one's local machines, the repository
includes software to add additional meta-data for IVOA
compliance and to generate VOTables from a *specdb*
database for standard SSA queries.

See the :doc:`privatedb` documentation for tips on how
to add meta data for IVOA compliance.

SSA Interface
=============

The repository includes a simple class `SSAInterface`
which ingests a *specdb* database and enables standard
SSA queries.

Instantiation
-------------

Instantiation is straightforward::

   from specdb import ssa as spdb_ssa
   ssai = spdb_ssa.SSAInterface(igmsp)

querydata
---------

One may perform a standard SSQ querydata using the interface.
Currently, only the POS, SIZE, and FORMAT parameters are
enabled::

   # votable = ssai.querydata(POS, SIZE=, FORMAT=)
   votable = ssai.querydata('0.0019,17.7737', SIZE=1e-3)

The method returns a VOTable generated by astropy.
See below for a listing of the standard meta parameters.
